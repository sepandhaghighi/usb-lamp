# üí° DIY USB Lamp

## üìù Overview

A simple and customizable USB-powered LED lamp project for electronics enthusiasts, students, and makers. This guide walks you through building a USB-powered lamp from scratch using basic electronic components. The lamp runs on the standard 5V supplied by any USB port (e.g., from a computer, power bank, or wall adapter), making it a portable and efficient lighting solution.
Whether you're just getting started with electronics or looking to add a small lighting solution to your workspace, this project provides a rewarding and educational experience with minimal cost and effort.

### Resistor Value Calculation

To calculate the appropriate resistor value:

$$R = \frac{5 - V_f}{I_f}$$

Where:
- $$V_f$$ = Forward voltage of the LED (depends on color)
- $$I_f$$ = Forward current (typically 5‚Äì20mA)

Different LED colors have different forward voltage drops ($$V_f$$). Using Ohm's law, here‚Äôs a reference table for choosing resistors:


| LED Color | Vf (V) | Suggested Resistor (Œ©) @15mA | Acceptable Range (Œ©) @5‚Äì20mA |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Red       | 2.0    | 200‚ÄØŒ©                         | 150‚ÄØŒ© ‚Äì 600‚ÄØŒ©                 |
| Green     | 2.2    | 180‚ÄØŒ©                         | 140‚ÄØŒ© ‚Äì 560‚ÄØŒ©                 |
| Yellow    | 2.2    | 180‚ÄØŒ©                         | 140‚ÄØŒ© ‚Äì 560‚ÄØŒ©                 |
| Blue      | 3.2    | 120‚ÄØŒ©                         | 90‚ÄØŒ© ‚Äì 360‚ÄØŒ©                  |
| White     | 3.2    | 120‚ÄØŒ©                         | 90‚ÄØŒ© ‚Äì 360‚ÄØŒ©                  |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Use the **next higher standard resistor** if the calculated value is not available (e.g., use 220Œ© instead of 207Œ©).


### ‚ö†Ô∏è USB Current Limits

- **USB 2.0 port** provides up to **500mA**
- This circuit typically draws **15‚Äì20mA**
- You can safely power one LED with plenty of margin

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Parallel LEDs

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can connect multiple LEDs in parallel, but each **must have its own resistor** to ensure proper current limiting.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never connect LEDs directly in parallel without individual resistors, and keep total current below USB limits (<**500‚ÄØmA**).
